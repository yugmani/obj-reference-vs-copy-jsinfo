  <h1>Object references and copying</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Primitive values:</h3>
      <p>
        strings, numbers, booleans, etc – are always copied “as a whole value”.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Objects</h3>
      <p>Objects are stored and copied “by reference”</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>
        A variable assigned to an object stores not the object itself, but its
        “address in memory” – in other words “a reference” to it.
      </h4>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>
        When an object variable is copied, the reference is copied, but the
        object itself is not duplicated.
      </h4>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Comparison by reference</h3>
      <p>Two objects are equal only if they are the same object.</p>
      <p>
        And two independent objects are not equal, even though they look alike
        (both are empty):
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Cloning and merging, Object.assign</h3>
      <p>
        Copying an object variable creates one more reference to the same
        object.
      </p>
      <p>How can we get a duplicate of an object?</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          create a new object and replicate the structure of the existing one by
          iterating over its properties and copying them on the primitive level.
        </li>
        <li>using <code>Object.assign()</code> method</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Nested cloning</h3></li>
  </ul>
